#unmask.js
###A very lightweight plugin to lazy load images for jQuery

Two years ago was the last update from Unveil (https://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil).

I have a couple ideas to make this awesome plugin better and i see there was a lot of pull request pending.

New features:
* Responsive data-src.
* Background compatibility.
* Tiny code optimization.
* Load hidden images.

###Browser support
Tested with all modern browsers.
